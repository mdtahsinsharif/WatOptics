Pseudo Code:
Inputs:
Weighted graph with nodes for rooms/washrooms as well as one node for the human.

Graph:
Corridors are represented by the edges of the graph
Nodes represent rooms & user
Each intersection between node and edge represents a door to rooms
-> Question: What about when corridors intersect in real life?
